# Test website with a fullscreen image

1) Put your image file at `assets/maintenance.png` (you can rename your file to match this name).
2) Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
3) Push this repo to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → pick the default branch and `/root`).

Notes
- The page uses CSS `background-size: cover` so the picture fills the entire page on any screen.
- If you prefer JPG, update the reference in `index.html` to `assets/maintenance.jpg` and use that filename.
